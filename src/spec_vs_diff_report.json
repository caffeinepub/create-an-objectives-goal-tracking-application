  "summary": "REQ-4 appears implemented by adding a Home item to the mobile bottom navigation with active-route styling. REQ-5 adds a visible checkbox and touch swipe gesture on goal cards to toggle completion with error toasts; however, the diff shows the toggle uses new dedicated completion endpoints rather than the existing update mutation as specified.",

      "reason": "The new completion toggle hook calls actor.setGoalCompleted / actor.setGoalNotCompleted rather than using the existing updateGoal mutation path, so the requirement to use the existing update mutation is not met based on the diff evidence.",
