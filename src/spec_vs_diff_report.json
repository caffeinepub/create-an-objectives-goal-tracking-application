  "summary": "Implemented new bottom navigation component and added routes/pages for Languages, Profile, Notifications, and Averages. AppShell now conditionally renders the bottom nav for authenticated users and adds bottom padding to prevent overlap. One notable deviation: the bottom nav is hidden on medium+ viewports (mobile-only).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Bottom navigation bar is visible on all app pages for authenticated users.",
      "reason": "The new bottom navigation is explicitly hidden on medium and larger screens via `md:hidden`, so it is not visible on all pages across all viewport sizes for authenticated users.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/app/AppBottomNav.tsx"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Bottom navigation is implemented as mobile-only (hidden on md+ viewports).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest did not specify limiting the bottom navigation to mobile; it asked for a persistent bottom navigation for authenticated users.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/app/AppBottomNav.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Averages page computes and displays aggregate metrics from goals (average progress, completion rate) with loading/error/empty states.",
      "reason": "REQ-2 only requested a page route and UI scaffold/title for Averages (explicitly non-goal to implement additional behavior beyond scaffold for Languages; Averages behavior was not requested).",
